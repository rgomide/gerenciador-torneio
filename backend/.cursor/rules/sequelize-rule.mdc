# Directives for sequelize

- This project use Sequelize v6 as ORM
- Here is the documentation page: https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/

## Model definition
- Everytime you create models, user standarts like in [event.js](mdc:src/models/event.js)
- Declare fields as camel case and use the `field` attribute to define the real name

## Seeders
- The seeder files should use queryInterface when it needs to query other models
- Don't import files from project
- The [20250402000003-demo-events.js](mdc:src/seeders/20250402000003-demo-events.js) file is a good reference

## Services
- Services should be module with functions, not classes
- Use [AppError.js](mdc:src/utils/AppError.js) to throw errors

## Tests

### Models
- Tests for models should be atomic, dont use beforeEach and afterEach sections
- It should use `toEqual` to check object content instead of check field by field value.
- Use `expect.any()` to check dynamic values as ids, updated at dates...

### Services
- Tests for models should be atomic, dont use beforeEach and afterEach sections
- Use a `describe` section per service function
- It should use `toEqual` to check object content instead of check field by field value.
